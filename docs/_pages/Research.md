## Time Competition for the News

  <p style="font-size: 16px;">The digital revolution has fundamentally reshaped journalism, accelerating the shift toward real-time reporting and transforming how audiences consume news. This study explores how ideological slant influences time competition in news reporting, focusing on Telegram—Russia’s most widely used social media platform. Using a novel dataset of publications from 77 news outlets between 2021 and 2023, I apply a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) algorithm to identify media events and measure reporting delays. To assess horizontal differentiation, I implement a three-step approach to identify government-sensitive topics and characterize outlets' ideological positions based on the proportion of articles with ideological framing. Model-free evidence reveals three key patterns. First, delays significantly reduce audience engagement, particularly for neutral outlets. Second, neutral outlets report faster than their ideologically slanted counterparts. Finally, as ideological slant intensifies, posting behavior becomes more structured—outlets are more likely to follow a set schedule rather than competing based on speed. A Difference-in-Differences analysis of Telegram’s "Similar Outlets" feature further suggests that intensified time competition incentivizes outlets to adopt stronger ideological positioning as a differentiation strategy. To quantify these effects, I develop a structural model and conduct counterfactual analysis to examine how platform-driven competition shapes editorial choices. This research provides new insights into the interplay between ideological bias and the pressures of real-time news production in the digital era.</p>
