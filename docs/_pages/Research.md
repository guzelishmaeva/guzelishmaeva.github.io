### Time Competition for the News
<details>
  <summary><strong style="color: #003366; font-size: 18px;">Abstract</strong></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">This study examines how ideological slant affects time competition in news reporting on Telegram, Russia’s most widely used social media platform. Using a dataset of publications from 77 news Telegram channels between 2021–2023 and a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) algorithm, I identify media events and measure reporting delays. To assess ideological differentiation, I analyze government-sensitive topics and the proportion of ideologically framed articles. Key findings reveal that reporting delays reduce audience engagement, especially for neutral outlets, which report faster than ideologically slanted ones. As ideological slant intensifies, outlets follow structured posting schedules rather than competing on speed. A Difference-in-Differences analysis of Telegram’s “Similar Outlets” feature suggests intensified competition pushes outlets toward stronger ideological positioning. To quantify these effects, I develop a structural model and conduct counterfactual analysis, exploring how platform-driven competition influences editorial choices. This research will provide new insights into the interplay between ideological bias and the pressures of real-time news production in the digital era. </p>

### Echo Chambers: Slant and Reader Exposure in Russia’s Telegram News *(with Michele Valinoti)*
<details>
  <summary><strong style="color: #003366; font-size: 18px;">Abstract</strong></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">This study examines ideological slant in the Telegram news market and its influence readership behavior. Leveraging the platform’s recommended channels feature, we find that users tend to follow outlets with similar ideological perspectives rather than seeking diverse viewpoints, raising concerns about reinforcing ideological bubbles. To explore these effects, we are conducting a survey in collaboration with the Levada Analytical Center, assessing respondents' awareness of key events from recent years and analyzing how their ideological positions correlate with the outlets they follow. Additionally, we employ language analysis tools and machine learning techniques to examine the linguistic patterns used by these channels, providing deeper insight into how information is framed and communicated. Our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of media consumption dynamics and ideological segregation in digital news environments, shedding light on the mechanisms that shape public discourse in the digital age.</p>

### The Limits of Propaganda with Strategic Communication
<details>
  <summary><strong style="color: #003366; font-size: 18px;">Abstract</strong></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;"> I propose a model in which agents can choose between supporting or not supporting the
government while the quality of the government is unknown. The sender uses propaganda
to introduce a bias to the public signal. Society consists of credulous and skeptical citizens
connected via a random matching mechanism. Credulous citizens follow the public signal
blindly, while skeptical citizens know the actual value of a bias and can spill information
about the value of bias among other citizens, but sharing information is costly. For the
sender, the lower informativeness of a signal increases the expected level of support from
credulous agents. Still, it raises the incentives for skeptical agents to spread information.
Comparative statics show that the increase in the average level of influence leads to lower
awareness or more aggressive propaganda. On the contrary, keeping the average level of
influence fixed, the higher inequality in the number of links may lead to a higher level of
awareness.
