## Time Competition for the News
<details>
  <summary><strong style="color: #003366; font-size: 18px;">Abstract</strong></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">The digital revolution has reshaped journalism, driving a shift toward real-time reporting and reshaping how audiences consume news. This study explores how ideological slant influences time competition in news reporting, focusing on Telegram—Russia’s most widely used social media platform. Using a novel dataset of publications from 77 news outlets between 2021 and 2023, I apply a Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) algorithm to identify media events and measure reporting delays. To assess horizontal differentiation, I implement a three-step approach to identify government-sensitive topics and characterize outlets' ideological positions based on the proportion of articles with ideological framing. Model-free evidence reveals three key patterns. First, delays significantly reduce audience engagement, particularly for neutral outlets. Second, neutral outlets report faster than their ideologically slanted counterparts. Finally, as ideological slant intensifies, posting behavior becomes more structured—outlets are more likely to follow a set schedule rather than competing based on speed. A Difference-in-Differences analysis of Telegram’s "Similar Outlets" feature further suggests that intensified time competition incentivizes outlets to adopt stronger ideological positioning as a differentiation strategy. To quantify these effects, I develop a structural model and conduct counterfactual analysis to examine how platform-driven competition shapes editorial choices. This research provides new insights into the interplay between ideological bias and the pressures of real-time news production in the digital era.</p>

## Echo Chambers: Slant and Reader Exposure in Russia’s Telegram News *(with Michele Valinoti)*
<details>
  <summary><strong style="color: #003366; font-size: 18px;">Abstract</strong></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">This study examines ideological slant in the Telegram news market and its impact on readership behavior. Leveraging the platform’s recommended channels feature, we find that users, including politicians, tend to follow outlets with similar ideological slants rather than seeking diverse perspectives. This raises concerns about potential echo chambers. To explore their effects, we are conducting a survey in collaboration with the Levada Center, assessing respondents' awareness of key events from recent years and analyzing how their knowledge correlates with the outlets they follow. Our findings contribute to the understanding of media consumption dynamics and ideological segregation in digital news environments.</p>

## The Limits of Propaganda with Strategic Communication
<details>
  <summary><strong style="color: #003366; font-size: 18px;">Abstract</strong></summary>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;"> propose a model in which agents can choose between supporting or not supporting the
government while the quality of the government is unknown. The sender uses propaganda
to introduce a bias to the public signal. Society consists of credulous and skeptical citizens
connected via a random matching mechanism. Credulous citizens follow the public signal
blindly, while skeptical citizens know the actual value of a bias and can spill information
about the value of bias among other citizens, but sharing information is costly. For the
sender, the lower informativeness of a signal increases the expected level of support from
credulous agents. Still, it raises the incentives for skeptical agents to spread information.
Comparative statics show that the increase in the average level of influence leads to lower
awareness or more aggressive propaganda. On the contrary, keeping the average level of
influence fixed, the higher inequality in the number of links may lead to a higher level of
awareness.
